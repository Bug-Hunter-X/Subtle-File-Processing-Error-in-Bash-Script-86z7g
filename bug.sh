# This script attempts to process a file, but it has a subtle bug.
# The issue is in how it handles the file input and error checking.

input_file="my_data.txt"

# Check if the file exists.  This is a common but insufficient check
if [ -f "$input_file" ]; then
  # Process the file (this is a placeholder - in real life, there is code here)
  echo "Processing file: $input_file"
  # The error here is that we are processing the file even if processing the file fails.
  # In real code this would probably be something like a loop reading lines and processing them.
  # Or potentially multiple files based on parameters.
  # If some processing fails (e.g. file is not in expected format) this continues processing
  # without indicating an error.
  #This needs to be handled properly and perhaps allow error handling to stop processing
